Kingly Folk Law of Civish Order

Section 1: Keeping Order Among the Folk This law sets rules to keep order and safety among the folk of United Friendiya. Folkmeetings, walks, and stands are allowed, as long as they are done in peace. To keep the folk safe, the law forbids acts like breaking, looting, and stirring trouble.

Curfews are set in times of unrest or need, asking folk to stay indoors from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM. Workers who are needed and those in need are free from this rule. Set grounds are given for folkmeetings to let free speech while lessening daily life upheaval.

Section 2: Lawkeepers' Deed Lawkeepers must go through ongoing training in calmness, folksâ€™ rights, and folk-engagement. Lawkeepers must wear body cameras while working to keep things clear.

A Folk-Eye Board is set up to look into grumbles against lawkeepers. This board is made up of folk from the neighborhood and lawwise folks who check claims of wrongdoing, making sure their outlook is fair and unbiased. The board can suggest punishments and changes in ways of lawkeeping.
