Ferdinand's Great Law of Wrongdoer Deeds

Section 1: Wrongdoings and Fines This law sets out what deeds are wrong, like theft, harming, murder, and cheating, with clear meanings for each wrongdoing. Fines are set based on how bad the deed is, from paying sums and working for the folk to being locked up. For a case, stealing stuff worth over 500 silver coins is punished by at least half a year in jail, while lesser thefts may mean fines or folk work.

Steps for helping non-harmful wrongdoers are put in place, focusing on schooling, work skill learning, and talks to help them not do wrong again and fit back into society.

Section 2: Steps for Wrongdoer Trials This law makes sure all accused folk get fair help by giving them law-aid if they can't pay for it. Trial steps must use set law papers and handling of proof to keep things fair.

For heavy wrongdoings, like murder or forced harm, trials must have a board of peers to make fair judgments. The law also safeguards the rights of the wronged and those who witnessed, giving help and shieldings during the trial.
