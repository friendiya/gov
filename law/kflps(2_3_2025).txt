Kingly Folk Law of Public Safety

Section 1: Readiness for Trouble This law sets rules for readiness and answering to troubles, such as land-ruining events, health scares, and folk upsets. Safeholds are put up in neighborhood halls and schools, filled with needed goods like food, water, and healing kits.

Safety drills are often held in schools, work spots, and neighborhoods to make sure folk are ready for troubles. The law asks for working together with local lawgivers for good answers to trouble, making sure swift and good use of means.

Section 2: Safety Rules Building laws and safety marks are kept to ward off mishaps and harms. Ongoing checks are done to see that these marks are met. The law sets up folk wisdom drives to teach folk on safety ways and steps for troubles.

A land-wide warning system is set up to give timely word during troubles, using many ways like the wireless, broadcasting, and handyphone words to reach all folk.
