Kleefstra's Law of Fair Means Giving

Section 1: Fair Sharing of Means This law makes sure of the fair sharing of needed goods, like food, water, and healing goods, in times of need. A sharing system is set up to put weak folk, such as children, elders, and the ill, first in line.

Section 2: Means Handling Gathering A Means Handling Gathering is made to watch over the giving and handing out of needed goods. The gathering sets up clear reporting and checking steps to stop lawlessness and see that things are done right.

The gathering works with worldwide groups and other lands to get more help and goods in times of need, making sure all folkâ€™s needs are met.
